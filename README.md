Load testing setup for [aftershock](http://www.opb.org/aftershock)

## What's in here?

* `aftershock.jmx` - JMeter test plan, depends on the presence of a `coords.csv` file, that is generated by...
* `sample_coords.r` - Generates a random (but weighted around populated areas) sample of coordinates within the covered area, based on...
* `boundary.shp` - a shapefile that simply defines the entire area to be tested as a single polygon.

## Instructions

To use this to test your own server, simply do the following:

1. Replace `boundary.shp` with a shapefile that represents the area you want to test.
2. Run `sample_coords.r` to get a list of sample coordinates in that area.
3. In `aftershock.jmx`, update the value of `<stringProp name="HTTPSampler.domain">` to match your server. **NB: this step is crucial, otherwise you'll be load-testing someone else's server, which is effectively a Denial Of Service attack.  Please don't do that!**
4. Use `coords.csv` as input for JMeter to test your deployment.

## Future work

Coming soon: the ability for https://github.com/missoula-ready/disaster-preparedness to create a boundary.shp automatically.
